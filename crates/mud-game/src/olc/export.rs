//! `do_export_zone` and the seven `export_save_*` helpers behind it — a
//! zone *portability* command, not a backup: it writes a copy of the zone
//! with every vnum rewritten so someone on another MUD can drop it in at a
//! vnum of their choosing.
//!
//! Five things here are worth knowing before changing them:
//!
//! * **No `system`.** Shelling out to `rm`, `tar` and `gzip` interpolates
//! the zone name unquoted, and `fix_filename` passes `;`, `&`, `` ` ``
//! and `$` straight through — so a builder who can rename their own zone
//! could run commands as the MUD user the next time an implementor
//! exports it. The archive bytes are emitted directly
//! (`super::archive`), which removes the shell entirely and makes the
//! command work on Windows.
//! * **Quests are exported.** The help text lists `.qst` among a zone's
//! files, so all eight formats are written, not seven.
//! * **The info file tells the truth about exits.** A `zone_exits` counter
//! incremented by `export_save_rooms` would be read by
//! `export_info_file`, which runs first — so every info file would claim
//! the zone has no exits out of it while the `.wld` is full of `ZZ`
//! markers. The outbound exits are gathered up front and reported from
//! that list.
//! * **Success accumulates.** `if (!(success = export_save_X(...)))`
//! overwrites the previous result, so only the last failure could stop
//! the archive. Every writer's result is kept instead.
//! * **The archive is named what the help promises.** The help says
//! `<zone #>_<zone name>.tgz`; `<name>.tar.gz` with no number would let
//! two zones with the same name overwrite each other.
//!
//! The vnum rewriting itself lives in `mud_world::write::VnumFmt`, so an
//! export runs through the same writers a real save does.
