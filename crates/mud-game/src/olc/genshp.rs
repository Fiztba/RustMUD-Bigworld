//! The shop half of the OLC generic layer.
//!
//! A shop's file fields and its runtime ones (`bank`, `sort`, `func`, and
//! the resolved keeper/product rnums) are split across two structures:
//! `mud_world::model::Shop` is the file data and `shop::ShopRt` the runtime
//! half, so `add_shop` has to land in both tables at the same index.
//!
//! Two representation notes:
//!
//! * `Shop::producing` holds object **vnums**; `ShopRt::producing` carries
//! the rnums for the runtime paths. The writer prints the vnum either way.
//! * `Shop::in_rooms` holds room vnums, which is why every display of
//! `S_ROOM` calls `real_room`.
