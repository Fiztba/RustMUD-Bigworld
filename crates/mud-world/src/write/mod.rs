/// How a writer renders the vnums it emits.

/// the vnum column, and such copies drift: an export .obj writer that never
/// gained the `timer` field, rooms that drop EX_HIDDEN from the door flag,
/// a .zon that `%100`s a cross-zone reference into a colliding
/// in-zone one, and its info file describes exits the rooms don't have.
/// Threading this formatter through the real writers instead makes an
/// export the same code path as a save, so it cannot drift again.
///
/// `Qq` is the scheme qq.info documents: every occurrence of the zone
/// number becomes `QQ`, and the recipient replaces it with theirs.
/// `Renumber` (`export <zone> <target>`) rewrites in-zone vnums into the
/// target zone's range instead, so the files drop straight in.
///
/// **Both forms mark a reference that leaves the zone `ZZnn`, never a real
/// vnum.** `ZZ` fails closed — `setup_dir`, `load_zones` and the shop
/// reader all refuse a vnum they cannot scan — whereas a live vnum the
/// destination happens not to have boots
/// fine and leaves a dead exit that `look <dir>` still describes.
///
/// The one format that does NOT mark is `.shp`: a shop legitimately stocks
/// other zones' goods — 377 of the shipped
/// products, 18 of the rooms and 19 of the keepers point outside their own
/// zone — so marking them would refuse to boot over something normal.
/// Those are handled the old way: lists drop the entry
/// ([`VnumFmt::in_zone`]),
/// and the keeper is forced into the zone's own numbering
/// ([`VnumFmt::push_zone_slot`]).
